# Hi there, I'm Son! 👋

## About Me
I'm an Software & ML Engineer enthusiast who builds new things and reads papers in my free time.

## What I'm Currently Working On
- High-performance, low-latency computer systems. I like fast things.
- Research in Spatial Intelligence, at intersection of vision, graphics, and ML.

## Some Past Projects
- [Feynman.ai](https://github.com/sontheteacher/Feynman.ai): We built a website to generate videos to explain math based on user's prompt, animated with [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim).
- [Stock Market Prediction with Random Forest](https://github.com/sontheteacher/Stock-Market-Prediction-with-RF): Implemented a paper aiming to predict direction of the stock market.
- [Credit Risk Prediction](https://github.com/sontheteacher/Credit-Risk-Prediction): Small Credit Risk Prediction project with traditional ML methods.
- [cscshell](https://github.com/sontheteacher/cscshell): A proudly done assignment, which I had to implement a Linux Shell from scratch. It can support most things you need on a daily basis!
- [ML Notebooks](https://github.com/sontheteacher/ML-Notebooks): List of ML notebooks I used, which might or might not be written by me.
